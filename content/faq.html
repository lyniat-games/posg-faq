    <p class="question">What are the minimum requirements for running PoSG?</p>
    <p class="answer">We implemented our custom render pipeline to draw the isometric pixel world and it's character at the best possible performance.

  <!-- QUESTION 06 -->
  <div class="aq" tags="faq6,modding">
    <p class="question">How can I add custom sprites/images and is it possible to animate them?</p>
    <p class="answer">The easiest step to do this is by using our partner WorldAnvil and create there custom NPCs with your own sprites. Since animations are pretty cool you can also add GIFs for simple stuff like an idle animation. If you want the real fancy way with different animations for different actions, we will publish our own tool to handle this and import your art into the game. More about this and generally the modding aspect and our partnership with WorldAnvil will be answered here and also announced at our Discord.</p>
